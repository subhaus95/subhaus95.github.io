<p>When the pandemic hit in early 2020, like many of us, I suddenly found myself with an abundance of unexpected free time.  With no real expectation that I would be returning to the role I was stood down from, I decided it was probably time to replace my aging (2011) Mac Mini and have something a bit more robust to work on, assuming that I might both be job hunting and/or working remote for the most part. This increased multi-mode digital dependency pushed me to evaluate the tools I was using daily. Building out a new workstation with bunch of different operating systems on it led me to need to solve the issue of a writing environment that was both multi-platform and available offline. Among these tools, perhaps none has had a more profound impact on my productivity and thinking than Obsidian.</p>

<h2 id="the-pre-obsidian-landscape">The Pre-Obsidian Landscape</h2>

<p>Before discovering Obsidian, my note-taking had taken me through several popular options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>OneNote</strong>: Great for organization but lacking in plain text portability</li>
  <li><strong>Apple Notes</strong>: Seamless across Apple devices but limiting in advanced features</li>
  <li><strong>Evernote</strong>: Once the gold standard, but became bloated and subscription-heavy</li>
  <li><strong>Various markdown editors</strong>: Loved the simplicity but missed the interconnectedness</li>
</ul>

<p>Each tool had its strengths, but none quite captured what I was looking for: a lightweight, future-proof system that could connect ideas rather than just store them.</p>

<h2 id="finding-obsidian-during-lockdown">Finding Obsidian During Lockdown</h2>

<p>In mid-2020, amid endless Teams, Zoom calls and sourdough attempts, I stumbled upon Obsidian. What initially caught my attention wasn’t just another feature list, but a fundamentally different approach to knowledge management:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Local-first storage</strong>: My notes are mine, stored as plain text files on my computer</li>
  <li><strong>Markdown-based</strong>: Simple, portable, and future-proof formatting</li>
  <li><strong>Bi-directional linking</strong>: The ability to connect notes and discover relationships between ideas</li>
  <li><strong>Graph view</strong>: Visualizing my knowledge network in a way that revealed unexpected connections</li>
</ol>

<p>The concept of a “second brain” resonated with me immediately, primarily because the first brain was struggling with the (un)reality of living through a modern day global pandemic at the time. Instead of fighting against an application’s structure, Obsidian seemed to adapt to how my mind naturally worked - or at least could keep up with it without losing fidelity in scraps of post-it notes, paper, Word docs, emails, etc.</p>

<h2 id="the-learning-curve-worth-climbing">The Learning Curve Worth Climbing</h2>

<p>I won’t pretend the transition was effortless. Coming from more structured tools like OneNote, I initially found the blank canvas of Obsidian intimidating. How should I organize things? What folders should I create? What metadata would be useful?</p>

<p>But this initial friction forced me to think deeply about my note-taking system rather than accepting someone else’s predetermined structure. Over time, I developed a system that worked specifically for me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Daily notes as entry points</li>
  <li>Topic-based folders for reference material</li>
  <li>Project-specific vaults for focused work</li>
  <li>Tags for cross-cutting themes</li>
</ul>

<p>The beauty of Obsidian is that it allowed this system to evolve organically as my needs changed.</p>

<h2 id="from-notes-to-networked-thinking">From Notes to Networked Thinking</h2>

<p>The real transformation came when I stopped thinking of Obsidian as just a note-taking app and started seeing it as a thinking environment. The connections between notes became as valuable as the notes themselves.</p>

<p>I began to notice patterns in my thinking, rediscover forgotten ideas, and make connections that wouldn’t have been possible in a linear note-taking system. Ideas from a book I read months ago would suddenly connect with a current project. Meeting notes would link to relevant research. Personal reflections would connect to professional insights.</p>

<p>This networked thinking fundamentally changed how I approached problems and projects.</p>

<h2 id="the-daily-driver-experience">The Daily Driver Experience</h2>

<p>Today, Obsidian has become my digital home base. It’s where I:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plan my day with daily notes</li>
  <li>Draft emails and messages before sending them</li>
  <li>Outline presentations and articles</li>
  <li>Track project progress</li>
  <li>Capture meeting notes</li>
  <li>Store reference material and research</li>
  <li>Reflect on personal and professional growth</li>
</ul>

<p>The extensibility through plugins has allowed me to adapt the tool to my specific workflows rather than adapting my workflows to the tool.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-notes-blogging-from-obsidian">Beyond Notes: Blogging from Obsidian</h2>

<p>Which brings me to my current experiment: using Obsidian not just for private notes but for public writing. This very blog post is being written in Obsidian before being published to this Jekyll-powered GitHub Pages site.</p>

<p>The hypothesis I’m testing is whether staying in this familiar environment—with its linked references, embedded notes, and customized workflow—will help maintain a regular cadence of blog posts.</p>

<p>The advantages so far are clear:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reduced friction</strong>: Writing happens in the same environment where my ideas develop</li>
  <li><strong>Rich context</strong>: Access to all my linked notes and references while writing</li>
  <li><strong>Consistent workflow</strong>: Using the same tools for both private thinking and public sharing</li>
  <li><strong>Future-proof format</strong>: Markdown files that can be used anywhere</li>
</ul>

<p>The publishing workflow is straightforward: write in Obsidian, export/copy to my Jekyll blog repository, push to GitHub, and the post is live. I’d say that the simplicity of this process removes many of the barriers that previously prevented me from posting regularly - but that would be an outright lie. I could have gone to Wordpress at any point to pick up on blogging again, but honestly, these past few years haven’t really been conducive to that. I’m sure there’s a “Dead Internet” post due from me in the near future along those lines.</p>

<h2 id="the-bigger-picture-tools-that-think-with-you">The Bigger Picture: Tools That Think With You</h2>

<p>My journey with Obsidian reflects a broader shift in how we think about productivity tools. The best tools aren’t just containers for information; they’re environments that enhance how we think.</p>

<p>What makes Obsidian special isn’t just its feature set but its philosophy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Knowledge should be connected, not just collected</li>
  <li>Tools should adapt to your thinking, not vice versa</li>
  <li>Your data should be yours in formats that will stand the test of time</li>
  <li>Simplicity and depth can coexist</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re still using notes apps that feel like digital filing cabinets rather than thinking environments, I’d encourage you to give Obsidian a try. The learning curve is real, but so is the payoff.</p>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>

<p>As I continue this experiment of blogging from Obsidian, I’m excited to see how it impacts not just the frequency of posts but their quality and interconnectedness. Will the networked thinking that’s been so valuable for my private notes translate to more insightful public writing?</p>

<p>That’s a hypothesis worth testing, and one I’ll report back on in future posts. For now, I’m grateful to have found a tool that’s not just helping me store information but helping me think better—during a pandemic and beyond.</p>

<p>The only other thing that I’ve been wanting to test out is whether or not I could get Mermaid to behave well from within Obsidian and straight to Jekyll posts. It took some wrangling to get this built out appropriately, but if you’re seeing a flowchart or two below, then it’s been a success. More on that later.</p>

It’s hard to encapsulate how I feel when the news that Rhys passed away is still so fresh.</p>

<p>I feel numb.</p>

<p>I posted to Twitter this morning with a photo of Rhys I took at the top of Grouse Mountain in Vancouver. He has been visiting us in our family home after spending a week at an IETF meeting downtown.</p>

<p>I made him hike his socks off on the North Shore with a trip around Lynn Creek and Lynn Valley/Mountain Highway, but rewarded him with a solid Canadian brunch. We followed that up with hiking the Grouse Grind and I think it’s fair to say I ruined his knees that day. The photo was taken just before our server brought out a couple of bottles of ice-cold beer that he used as a salve on his joints.</p>

<p>The kids loved having him around. He was always such easy company and great fun to be around. We are so much poorer for losing him.</p>

<p>With everything going on in the world at present, there is some guilt mixed in with the sheer joy of spending time with a bunch of youth at their Ski Camp this past weekend. We were lucky enough to be invited along to this one and I offered to help out with shifting gear to and from the hill as well as hanging around on the slopes.</p>

<p>It’s almost three years to the day since we last ran a camp for Scout-aged youth to test out their skiing skills on big mountain terrain. This past weekend saw a few of the Senior Scouts and their peers in Vents take to the slopes of Sunshine Ski Resort in Banff, AB.</p>

<p>As camps go, this kind of linking event was again a reminder of just how fortunate we are to be able to spend time guiding and mentoring these kids in activities they love to try and time they want to spend with each other. It’s a real privilege to see how much they have grown and developed as individuals and as a community during the most tumultuous times we have witnessed in generations.</p>

<p>Selfishly, it also meant that I had time with other adults who see the promise and purpose in giving up their time for these kids.</p>

<p>It is difficult to overstate just how very normal and understated the entire weekend was. These kids continue to grow up in a world that is so very different to that of my own youth and it is my firm belief that by providing them these opportunities is at least some route to normalcy.</p>

<p>Ice Safety was the core theme to the weekend, given we were sat at the side of a large enough lake to offer a great risk landscape.  We took to the ice with an auger and talked over ice thickness for weight support and signs to watch for in ice conditions. It’s always intersting to see confidence grow in the skills we teach from those who are maybe just that little more nervous about trying something new.</p>

<p>Having a smaller showing of participants actually made for a more effective camp given there was a good ratio of skilled and experienced folks to new and less experienced kids.</p>]]></content><author><name>Paul Hobson</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last weekend saw us out at Water Valley towards the foothills for our annual Winter Camp.

I can’t even remember when the old Wordpress blog went by the wayside, but it’s quite some time ago. *I just checked, it’s been a few years according to the ol’ reliable of archive.org.</p>

<p>Anyway, ‘HI!’ again, for those of you who may have happened upon me before, and welcome to anyone else who might be here as a new reader or passive observer. Eye-rollers are also welcome. Even occasional tutters.</p>

<h4 id="reasons-to-be-digitally-cheerful">Reasons to be (digitally) cheerful.</h4>

<p>One of the main reasons for me to slap all this back together is because I’m so done with trying (and failing) to make Facebook or other social platforms actually work for me in a way that’s conducive to either getting things out of my head and on paper or in building positive relationships with new people.</p>

<p>All those social megavendors are just massive digital landfills to me now. I actually rejoined Facebook in a limited capacity because of the pandemic, after swearing off it and going dark. It feels like a mistake being back there. I love the fact I’m reconnected with some folks from my old friend list (although it is heavily curated now). The problems that were apparent a couple of years ago haven’t improved though. It feels even more polarised than ever. It’s almost like people are trapped in there and are trying desperately to keep going while ignoring the rot going on all around them.</p>

<p>I am going to sound incredibly old with all of this - likely because I <em>am</em>, in internet years at least. In those <em>old</em> days of the internet, I have met some truly amazing people. Some have become close friends and the opportunities that were opened up through meeting them changed my life. That’s what I hope to recapture here and hopefully help others find along the way too.</p>]]></content><author><name>Paul Hobson</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve decided to resurrect the Breadedcod.com site after a fairly lengthy hiatus.

<p>Hello! I’m Paul, a technology leader with over 25 years of international experience in directing successful strategic digital business transformation initiatives. Welcome to this loose collection of occasional ramblings, hacked out on a keyboard mostly from my basement office at home.</p>

<p>I’m getting back on the horse, so to speak, and sub.haus is an opportunity for me to get stuff out of my head and written down. It’s as simple as that.</p>

<p>When I’m not immersed in technology strategy, I enjoy spending time in the Canadian wilderness. I’m a certified wilderness and remote first aid responder, which speaks to my interest in being prepared for any situation—both in technology and in life.</p>

<p>I’m also proficient in French, published in academic journals, and continue to maintain an active interest in research and education alongside my professional career.</p>
